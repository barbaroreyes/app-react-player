          Bridge is played with four people sitting at a card table using a
          standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers). The players across from each
          other form partnerships as North‑South and East‑West.
        </p>
        <p className="paa">
          Draw cards to select the person to deal the cards (the dealer). This
          person distributes the cards face down, in clockwise rotation one at a
          time, until each player at the table has a hand consisting of 13
          cards.
        </p>
        <p className="paa">
          After the play of each deal is completed, the opportunity to deal
          moves around the table clockwise so that each person has a turn to
          deal out the cards.
